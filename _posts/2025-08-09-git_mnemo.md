# 📝 Git Quick Reference – Day-to-Day Workflows

This is a compact, **practical Git cheat sheet** for everyday use. Perfect for beginners and intermediates who want quick reminders for the most common commands.  
You can print it, stick it on the wall, or keep it in your GitHub Pages site for reference.

---

## 📥 1. Get an External Repo (Clone)
```bash
git clone <repo_url>
````

Example:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
```

---

## 🔄 2. Sync Local Branch with GitHub

```bash
git checkout main          # Switch to main
git pull origin main       # Get latest updates
```

---

## 💾 3. Commit a Local Change to `main`

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main       # Avoid conflicts
git add .                  # Stage all changes
git commit -m "Message"    # Commit with a message
git push origin main       # Push to GitHub
```

---

## 🌿 4. Create & Switch to a New Branch

```bash
git checkout -b <branch_name>
```

Example:

```bash
git checkout -b feature-login
```

---

## 📤 5. Push a Branch for the First Time

```bash
git push -u origin <branch_name>
```

---

## 🔀 6. Merge a Branch into `main`

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge <branch_name>
git push origin main
```

---

## 🗑 7. Discard Local Changes

* **Single file**:

```bash
git checkout -- <file>
```

* **All changes**:

```bash
git reset --hard
```

---

## 🕵️ 8. Inspect Changes & History

```bash
git status          # See staged/unstaged changes
git log --oneline   # Quick commit history
```

---

## 🛠 9. Common “Rescue” Commands

Sometimes things go wrong. Here are quick fixes:

* **Undo the last commit but keep changes**:

```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

* **Undo the last commit and discard changes**:

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

* **Revert a specific commit without changing history**:

```bash
git revert <commit_hash>
```

* **See differences between local and GitHub**:

```bash
git fetch
git diff origin/main
```

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

* Use `git status` **constantly** to see what’s going on.
* Always `git pull` before starting new work.
* Use meaningful commit messages.
* Work on feature branches to avoid breaking `main`.
