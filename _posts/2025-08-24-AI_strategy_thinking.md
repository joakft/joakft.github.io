\# Study Guide — Strategic AI/ML (Tier 3 Level, Expanded)

This is the \*\*strategic frontier\*\*.    
Here, technical strength isn’t enough — leaders must handle \*\*enterprise-scale trade-offs, governance, economics, and organizational transformation\*\*.    
Each section shows the difference between \*fakers, strong Tier 2 ICs, and true Tier 3 strategic leaders\*.

\---

\## 1. Enterprise AI Vision & Roadmapping

\### Faker Line  
\*“We should adopt AI because it’s the future and gives us a competitive edge.”\*

\### Tier 2 (Strong IC/Principal)  
\- Can map current projects into a technical roadmap (models, pipelines, infra upgrades).    
\- Focused on scaling what exists and incrementally improving performance.  

\### Tier 3 (Lead/Head Strategy)  
\- Defines \*\*multi-year AI adoption strategy\*\* across the enterprise.    
\- Balances \*\*innovation vs risk appetite\*\*:   
 - 12–18mo horizon: tactical ML automation, operational gains.    
 - 3–5y horizon: platform unification, agentic AI, enterprise-wide decision automation.    
\- Identifies \*\*platform inflection points\*\* (when to unify infra, when to move to new paradigms like agentic orchestration).    
\- Frames AI adoption as a \*\*business transformation program\*\*, with exec sponsorship and measurable enterprise KPIs (revenue growth, compliance cost savings, resilience).

 - \*\*Lock-in vs control\*\*: Cloud vendor vs open-source/foundation models.    
 - \*\*Security/compliance vs innovation\*\*: sensitive workloads must stay internal.    
\- Builds \*\*hybrid models\*\*:    
 - OSS LLMs for sensitive, regulated tasks (e.g., fraud detection).    
 - API providers for creative/commodity use-cases.    
\- Owns \*\*strategic vendor partnerships\*\* (hyperscalers, AI labs, regulators).  

\---

\## 3. Governance, Compliance & Risk

\### Faker Line  
\*“We must follow GDPR and ensure AI is fair and explainable.”\*

\- Sets \*\*capacity planning strategy\*\*:    
 - Reserved vs spot vs on-prem accelerators.    
 - Balancing capital investment vs operating expense.    
\- Positions infra economics in \*\*board/CFO language\*\*: TCO, ROIC, payback periods.

\- Frames \*\*data as capital leverage\*\*:    
 - Proprietary identity graphs → defensible fraud platform.

\## Final Note  
This is the \*\*strategic tier\*\*.    
Fakers collapse into clichés.    
Tier 2 speaks well about infra trade-offs and technical roadmaps.    
Tier 3 defines \*\*multi-year vision, governance, economics, workforce, and ecosystem position\*\* — making AI an \*\*enterprise transformation lever\*\* tied to CEO/CFO-level outcomes.    
That’s the true Lead/Head strategy profile.
