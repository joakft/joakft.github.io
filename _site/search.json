    "text": "1 Introduction\nTechnology evolves by shifting the bottleneck. Each generation of tools solves one constraint, only to reveal the next.\n\nIn the era of software engineering, the challenge was making programs reliable and deployable at scale. Practices like automated testing, version control, and continuous integration turned fragile code into something industrial.\n\nWith the rise of machine learning, the challenge became managing data and models across their lifecycle. The response was pipelines and monitoring that allowed models to be deployed and updated reliably, not just prototyped in notebooks.\n\nNow, with the surge of AI and foundation models, we face another shift. The bottleneck is no longer writing software or even building models ‚Äî those are increasingly commoditized. The bottleneck is how to manage decisions: how to orchestrate models, rules, and human input into reliable, adaptive, and auditable systems.\n\n\n2 Why Decisions Are the New Unit of Management\nEvery important business outcome comes down to decisions: approving a transaction, setting a price, ranking a product, showing a recommendation. These decisions are made not by a single model, but by an interconnected system of data pipelines, predictive components, business constraints, and feedback loops.\nThe question for the next decade is: how do we make these decision systems as manageable as software has become?\nThat means:\n\nAutomation: Decisions need pipelines, not manual interventions.\n\nOrchestration: Multiple intelligent artifacts ‚Äî models, rules, heuristics ‚Äî must work together coherently.\n\nAdaptability: With AI in the loop, decisions should evolve continuously as data and environments change.\n\nTrustworthiness: Every decision should be explainable and auditable, not an opaque black box.\n\nManageability: Complexity must be tamed through modular design, observability, and reproducibility.\n\n\n\n3 What This Looks Like in Practice\n\nBuilt-in experimentation: Any change to a decision process is tested, measured, and rolled back if necessary, the way code deployments are managed today.\n\nContinuous feedback: Each decision feeds back into the system, enabling rapid adaptation rather than periodic retraining.\n\nGovernance by design: Logs, explanations, and audits are first-class outputs, not afterthoughts.\n\nOptimization under constraints: Methods like bandits, reinforcement learning, or simulation are applied to balance exploration and exploitation, revenue and risk, short-term and long-term effects.\n\nOperational rigor: Latency, cost-per-decision, and quality are tracked with the same discipline we apply to uptime and error rates in software systems.\n\n\n\n4 The Consistent Pattern\nAcross each wave, the value shifted:\n\nSoftware: The problem was deployment and reliability ‚Üí the solution was DevOps.\n\nModels: The problem was managing the data and model lifecycle ‚Üí the solution was MLOps.\n\nDecisions: The problem now is managing complexity, adaptability, and trust at the level of decisions ‚Üí the solution is to treat decisions themselves as software artifacts, subject to automation, orchestration, and governance.\n\n\n\n5 Closing Thought\nThe AI wave makes this shift urgent. As models become cheap and abundant, what will differentiate organizations is not who has the biggest model, but who can build decision systems that are fast, adaptive, and trustworthy.\nIn other words, the future is not just about better models. It‚Äôs about making decisions themselves software-like: automated, orchestrated, continuously improving, and never spiraling out of control.\nThat is where the next decade of value will come from."
